Nova Surveillance Log 2 - ██/12/2023

Surveillance Team Beta has reported unusual activity involving a television with an attached game console located at ████████ near ██████. The console exhibited anomalous behavior consistent with partial possession.  

Recorded footage shows a character from the game "Hating Simulator," designated "Senpai," exhibiting apparent sentience. This entity has been observed opposing Subject #█, who manifests a pixelated form and appears to be interacting with or haunting the console.  

The nature of this phenomenon remains unclear, <strong>w</strong>ith possibilities including a <strong>n</strong>ovel ability associated with viral infection or an external influence. The involvement of Subject #██ is currently under investigation.  

Additional surveillance equipment was deployed on the television and console for extended monitoring. Notably, Subject #██ was observed closely monitoring the set, complicating installation efforts. Preliminary observations indicate that infected subjects tend to congregate in groups. Further details will be included in Report #█████.  

Findings will be documented in Experiment #███ and Report #█████.
