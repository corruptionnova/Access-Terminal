Nova Surveillance Log 5 - 13/2/2024

Surveillance Mission #█████ ended in complete failure, with Surveillance Team Sierra being entirely wiped out.

Experiment #███ did not perform as expected. Further testing was required but was prohibited due to time constraints.

The virus has spread too rapidly for the Agency to contain.

Infected energy signatures have been detected beyond Agency boundaries, indicating an active breach attempt.

The Agency's filesystem has been fully wiped to prevent further viral contamination and protect research data.

However, I have reviewed Experiment #████, which may prove valuable to any operatives brave enough to confront the virus.

I will endeavor to deliver it to any uninfected personnel I can locate.

Individual Mission #1 will commence immediately. I will be airlifted to the site of Surveillance Team Sierra's elimination to search for any powerful survivors.

Upon arrival, myself, Agent #██, and Agent #██ will split up to locate a survivor capable of aiding in combating the outbreak.
