Nova Surveillance Log 4 - ██/1/2024

Surveillance Team Kil<strong>o</strong> has lost contact with Agency Headquarters following the transmission of their latest log.

Nevertheless, the reports from Agents #██████ and #█████ have provided valuable intelligence.

Further information pertaining to Report #████ has been obtained. Infected groups have been observed forming clusters based on pre-existing relationships prior to infection.

Subjects #█ and #██ were documented collaborating in an attempt to infect Subject #██. Subject #██ mounted a strong resistance, nearly regaining control, displaying traits consistent with the rest of the ███████ ██████ as documented in Experiment #███, Surveillance Mission #████, and Experiment #██.

Note: Update the files for Subjects #█ and #█ with these findings.

The helicopter assigned to Surveillance Team Kilo has reappeared on radar. Surveillance Team Sierra has been ordered to deploy agents to track the helicopter's origin and initiate field deployment of Experiment #███.
